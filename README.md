### Hi there! Welcome to my Github profile!

Machine Learning | Software Architecture Fullcycle | DevOps

After so many years working in the field, it would be impractical to list everything I've worked on, from telecommunications, network administration, to software developer, software architect and project management. The fact is that I never felt attached to any programming language, operating system or any tools, but these are some of the ones I have the most experience with recently

Area | Desc
------------- | -------------
Machine Learning | Tensorflow 2, PyTorch, FastIA, Scikit-learn
FullCycle Software Architecture | .NetFramework/.NetCore, C/C++, NodeJS, Python, using many different tools (experienced with low level programming on SO's kernels)
DevOps | Github/Bitbucket pipelines, AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker/Kubernets, very experienced with On Premise hosting as well
Databases | Oracle, SqlServer, Redis, RavenDB, MongoDB and others (I love optimizing SQL queries)
Security | Solid knowledge and experience on software security (network, encryption and pentest) but it is not my focus of study at the moment
