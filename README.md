### Hi there! Welcome to my Github profile! <img align="left" alt="GitHub" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/78df643247d429f6cc873026c0622819ad797942/topics/github/github.png" />

ðŸ’¬ [Ask me about anything](https://forms.gle/Cqbwq4fGKtPbHwJG6)

<br />

After so many years working in the field, it would be impractical to list everything I've worked on, from telecommunications, network administration, to software developer, software architect and project management. 

The fact is that I never felt restricted to any programming language, operating system or any tools, but these are some of the ones I have the most experience with, working recently.

- **IA (NN/ML)**: Tensorflow 2, PyTorch, FastIA, Scikit-learn, ETL and BI tools like PowerBI and Tableau
- **FullCycle Software Architecture**: .NetFramework/.NetCore, Python, NodeJS, C/C++, using many different tools (I really like low level programming on SO's internals/kernels)
- **DevOps**: Github/Bitbucket pipelines, AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker/Kubernets, (I also have a lot of experience with On Premise hosting)
- **Databases**: Oracle, SqlServer, Redis, RavenDB, MongoDB and others (I love optimizing SQL queries)
- **Security**: Solid knowledge and experience on software security (network, encryption algorithms and pentest)
