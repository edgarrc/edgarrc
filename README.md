### Hi there! Welcome to my Github profile!

After so many years working in the field, it would be impractical to list everything I've worked on, from telecommunications, network administration, to software developer, software architect and project management. 

The fact is that I never felt attached to any programming language, operating system or any tools, but these are some of the ones I have the most experience with, working recently.

- **IA (ML/NN)**: Tensorflow 2, PyTorch, FastIA, Scikit-learn, ETL and BI tools like BI and Tableau
- **FullCycle Software Architecture**: .NetFramework/.NetCore, C/C++, NodeJS, Python, using many different tools (I really like low level programming on SO's internals/kernels)
- **DevOps**: Github/Bitbucket pipelines, AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker/Kubernets, (lots of experience with On Premise hosting as well)
- **Databases**: Oracle, SqlServer, Redis, RavenDB, MongoDB and others (I love optimizing SQL queries)
- **Security**: Solid knowledge and experience on software security (network, encryption and pentest)
